design and programming.

The task is to build a game that model the paper-based game,
Battleships. Each player has a 10x10 two dimensional board which they place a number of
battleships of varying sizes.

Once aach player places their ships on their board they takes turns to
take shots at their oppponents board. If the square is occupied by
a ship the attacking player notes a hit and a miss if the grid is empty.

The game is over when all of one player's ships have been. The winner is
the player with ships left on the board.
